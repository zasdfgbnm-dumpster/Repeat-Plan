To use this widget, you have to ensure your konsolekalendar installed
and configured.  For most people the konsolekalendar tool is already
installed with kde.  You can simply test whether your konsolekalendar
is well configured by by running the command "konsolekalendar".  If it
displays your events in your calendar correctly, that means your
kolsoleklendar has already been configured well.  If not, go to
"System Settings"->"Personal Information"->"KDE Resources"->"Calendar"
and then add the resource(s) you want here.
